বৃষ্টি নামল অন্ধকার রাতে। ঝড়ের শব্দে কাঠের জানালা কাঁপছিল, যেন অদৃশ্য কেউ ধাক্কা দিচ্ছে। আমি পুরনো সেই বাড়িটায় একা। ঠাকুরদার留下的 oriya বাড়ি, years ধরে abandoned। প্রয়োজনেই এসেছি, নাহলে কখনো আসতাম না এই ভাঙা বাড়িতে।

বৃষ্টির water ঢুকছিল ছাদের ফুটো দিয়ে। মোমবাতির আলোয় shadows নাচছিল দেয়ালে। হঠাৎ শুনলাম, someone is walking upstairs... heavy steps... but I am alone downstairs. The steps stopped at my door. My heart stopped. The doorknob began to slowly turn...

কিছুক্ষণ nothing happened. Then a faint sound... like a child crying somewhere in the dark corridor. The sound was coming closer. I held the candle and went towards the sound. The crying stopped abruptly right behind me. I turned slowly...

There was no one. Only the old broken mirror on the wall, where my pale, terrified face was reflected. And then I saw... in the mirror, right behind my shoulder... a pair of black eyes staring at me without blinking.

I screamed and turned around, but there was nothing there. Only the empty, dark corridor and the sound of the storm. When I looked back at the mirror, the eyes were gone. But I knew... I was not alone in this house. Something was here with me. And it was getting closer with every passing moment. The candle flame flickered violently, as if an icy breath had touched it.

Suddenly, a whisper came from very close to my ear, cold and clear...

"পিছন ফিরে দেখো..."
