**বাংলার পথে পথে**

শস্য শ্যামল বাংলা, সোনারHarvest my soul is rooted
In the soil of Bengal,
Where golden harvests ripen,
And life's true meaning dawns.

My heart dances to the rhythm
Of the flowing rivers,
And the gentle breeze that whispers
Through the emerald fields.

The songs of the cuckoos serenade my spirit,
And the vibrant colors of the flowers
Paint my world with joy and wonder.

In the embrace of Bengal's beauty,
My soul finds solace,
And my spirit soars,
Forever bound to this land of dreams.
